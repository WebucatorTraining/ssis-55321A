#  Lesson 08: Containers

In this lab, you will reinforce the concepts taught in this chapter by creating a package that utilizes a Foreach
 Loop Container. You will also create packages to copy both an entire database, as well as individual objects in a
 database, from one database to another.

You must have a mail forwarder configured to accept mail messages from the alias AdventureWorks.com for this lab
 to work. If you are using an actual mail server, you must modify the email addresses both in the package and in
 the data source to be valid email addresses for your server.
