#  Lesson 06: Data Flow Transformations

In this lab, you will modify the **DataSourcesandDestinations.dtsx** package created in
 the prior chapterâ€™s lab to add
 transformations required to modify the data before sending it to one or more destinations. Through the exercises,
 you
 will explore adding a new column to the data flow. You will concatenate the values from two of the existing columns
 to
 populate this new column. You will also look up a value from a different data source, and then add that value to the
 data flow. Finally, you configure your data flow to help look for possible inconsistencies in the data by grouping
 similar rows together.
