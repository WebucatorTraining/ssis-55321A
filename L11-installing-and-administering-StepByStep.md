# Lesson 11 Lab Instructions

## Exercise 1: Answer Key

Please note, there are several ways to accomplish the same task in SSIS. The book uses a variety of methods to
 expose
 you to different options. Feel free to use your favorite method throughout the exercises.

The goal of this exercise is to review the process of using jobs to automate package executions. In this exercise,
 you will create a job to run the **DynamicPackage.dtsx** and schedule that job to run on
 two different
 schedules.

1. Change the NTFS permissions on the Chapter 10QA and Chapter 10Dev folders so that the Users (or Domain Users)
 group has Full Control of each folder.
    1. Open File Explorer.
    2. Browse to the **Studentfiles\Chapter 10QA** folder.
    3. Right-click the **Studentfiles\Chapter 10QA** folder, and then click

2. Create a new job named **WeeklyPackage**.
    1. If necessary, open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to the Database Engine.

     rather than a red down arrow on the server icon as shown . If not, right-click the **SQL Server
     Agent**, and then click `Start`.
    3. In Object Explorer, expand **SQL Server Agent**, right-click the **Jobs** folder,
     and then click `New Job`.
    4. In the New Job dialog box, type **WeeklyPackage** in the Name field.
3. Configure the first step of the WeeklyPackage job to execute the **DynamicPackage.dtsx** package deployed in
 Chapter 9.

    8. After the second schedule is defined, click `OK` to close the New Job dialog box.
7. Test the job by running it manually.
    1. In Object Explorer, expand **SQL Serve Agent > Jobs**, right-click the
     **WeeklyPackage** job, and then click **Start job at step.**
    2. Wait for the job to finish running, and then click `Close`.

     Status and Duration of this execution.
    4. Click the Overview link in the row with the most recent time to see the general execution report including
     the
     list of parameters used. Verify that the parameters for the QA environment were used.
    5. In the toolbar just under the tab titled overview, click the **Navigate Backward**  icon at the
     top of the window to return to the All Executions report.
    6. On the All Executions report, click the **All Messages** link in the row with the most recent
