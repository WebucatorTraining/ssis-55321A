#  Lesson 07: Making Packages Dynamic

There are many situations where you will need to change server names, paths, and data being retrieved, either in
 different environments, or each time a package is run. Additionally, your packages may need to retrieve files of an
 unknown name from a folder, or process all of the rows in a result set. A combination of variable, parameters, and
 expressions will give you this functionality and more. In this lab, you will practice using a combination of
 variables,
 expressions, and parameters to make the package more dynamic.
