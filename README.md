Used by Skillable to create lab instructions.

### Notes for Nat
These files were created using the markdown.py script in the courseware-sql repo.
This requires copying over all created markdown files and all images in the **Manual/Images** folder into the local **Images** folder.

After converting:
1. In **L03-control-flow-StepByStep.md**, tab in lines 107-116
2. In **L04-common-tasks-StepByStep.md**
   1. Move "If you are using a corporate email server, the To and From addresses should both be your email address." to line before an italicize.
   2. Unindent one level lines 182-187.
3. In **L06-transformations-StepByStep.md**, delete `\n` at line 155.
4. In **L07-making-packages-dynamic-StepByStep.md**, delete `\n` at lines 103 and 201 (with preceding 4 spaces).
5. **L08-containers-HighLevel.md** contained all the high-level and step-by-step instructions, and L08-containers-StepByStep.md contained none of it. Fix that.
6. In **L09-reliability-StepByStep.md**, delete lines 54 and 75, and tab in lines 64-66.
